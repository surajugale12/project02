	<h2> Creation and Development </h2>
	<p id="description">
		With issue #15 (Aug. 1962) Amazing Adult Fantasy was retitled Amazing Fantasy.[3] This issue'
		s lead feature introduced the superhero Spider-Man, written by Lee and drawn by Ditko, although Lee rejected
		Ditko's cover art and commissioned
		Jack Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked.[3] As Lee explained in 2010: "I think I had Jack sketch out a
		cover fo
		r it because I always had a lot of confidence
		in Jack's covers".[4] In numerous interviews Lee
		has recalled how the title had been slated for canc
		ellation, and so with nothing to lose, publisher Marti
		n Goodman reluctantly agreed to allow him to introduce
		Spider-Man, a new kind of superhero – one who would be a teenager, but not a sidekick,
		and one who would have everyman doubts, neuroses and money problems.[5] However,
		while this was indeed the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that "the
		Spiderman [sic] ... will
		appear every month in Amazing".[3][6]
